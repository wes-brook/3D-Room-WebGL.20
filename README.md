## Description
I made a web page for a controllable 3D Cube using WebGL 2.0 and the Phong Reflection Lighting Model. This project showcases basic 3D graphics concepts, including vertex and fragment shaders, camera controls, and lighting techniques. I think itâ€™s pretty cool.

## Features
- **Interactive 3D Cube**: Rotate the cube using keyboard controls.
- **Phong Reflection Model**: Implements ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting to create realistic shading on the cube's surface.
- **Responsive Design**: The canvas adjusts to different screen sizes for a better viewing experience.

## Tech Stack
- **WebGL 2.0**: For rendering 3D graphics.
- **JavaScript**: For application logic and interactions.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the basic structure and styling of the web page.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser that supports WebGL 2.0.
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
